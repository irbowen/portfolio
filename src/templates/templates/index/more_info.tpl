           <h3>The Beginning <br/> College Pro Painters </h3>
           <p>
           I climbed high ladders carrying heaving buckets of paint in the hot sun
           I was good at it, and got promoted to job site manager
           I was so good at it actually, that my boss ended up firing every one else on the team, and had me work more hours

           <h3>The Beginning <br/> Dininng Hall </h3>
           <p>
           Then, I started working at the dining hall.
           I noticed pretty quicky that dishroom was my jam.
           Again, I was really good at it, and I moved up to a student coordinator very quickly. I worked there too much, got in trouble for working overtime a few times.
           I worked there for the better part of two years. Learned a lot. </p>

           <h3>The Beginning <br/> UMTRI </h3>
           <p>
           At UMTRI (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute), 
           I performed IT tasks for a research office of ~150 people.
           This included setting up servers, debugging and installing software on workstations, managing the internal LAN, etc.
